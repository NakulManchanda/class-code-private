# Mini LLM Serving System

The entire assignment is about one idea: **the GPU is scarce**. Decide carefully what work enters, what work runs next, and where it runs. Then measure whether your decisions actually helped.

You are going to build a **fake** LLM serving system. There is no real model and no GPU. Imagine 100 users sending requests to an LLM server, but your server has limited capacity. Your system has to answer three questions:

1. Should I accept this request? → **Admission control**
2. Which request should run next? → **Scheduler**
3. Which worker/GPU should receive it? → **Router**

Finally, you will connect all three and test the complete system.

Laptop only. Do not run this on Lambda. Do not import `gateway/`.

```
cd class-code/class7/hw
pytest tests/test_admit.py
python generate_traces.py
```

## The request

Every request has:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | unique id |
| `arrival_t` | arrival time |
| `priority` | `0` = important/interactive, `20` = batch |
| `prompt_tokens` | size of the input |
| `max_new_tokens` | maximum output size |
| `prefix_hash` | identifies shared input, or `None` |
| `timeout_s` | how long the user is willing to wait |
| `tenant` | customer/user group |

Your fake server has limited:

| Resource | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `decode_slots` | how many requests can generate tokens at once |
| KV blocks | memory available for running requests |
| prefill tokens | how much input we can process per step |

Think of these as the server's three scarce resources.

This exercise has 4 parts.

---

## Part 1. Admission Control — Should we accept the request?

File: `admit.py`

Write:

```
should_shed(req, snap)
```

It answers: "Is the server too busy to safely accept this request?"

Return:

```
(shed?, code, retry_after_seconds)
```

### First: write these tests

Your tests must show:

| Situation | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tenant has used 96% of token allowance | reject with 429 |
| Tenant has used 96% of request allowance | reject with 429 |
| Request would probably wait > half its timeout | reject with 503/529 |
| Only 5% KV memory remains + new prefix | reject with 503/529 |
| Only 5% KV memory remains + prefix already exists | accept |
| Very bad tail latency + interactive request | accept |
| Very bad tail latency + batch request | reject |

`tests/test_admit.py` is that table. `pytest tests/test_admit.py` stays red until `should_shed` is real.

### Then implement these rules

**1. Protect tenants.**

Check the tenant's token limit before its request-count limit.

Why? Ten requests are not necessarily ten times the same amount of work.

**2. Don't accept requests that are already doomed.**

Estimate:

```
expected queue wait = queue length × p50 TTFT
```

If that is more than half of the request's timeout, reject it.

**3. Don't run out of KV memory.**

If less than 8% of KV memory remains, reject a request whose prefix is not already cached. A request using a prefix we already have is allowed in.

**4. Protect interactive users.**

If p99 latency is more than 4× p50 latency and the queue is growing:

- keep `priority < 10` requests
- reject `priority >= 10` requests

Admission control does not retry requests or move them to another worker. It only says accept or reject.

Use:

- `429` = tenant limit
- `503` / `529` = server capacity

### Short question

In about ½ page, explain which of your rules represents the ideas behind:

- DALL·E's 5-minute cancellation
- Anthropic's late-capacity behavior
- Cloudflare overload protection

---

## Part 2. Scheduler — Which request gets the GPU?

File: `sched.py`

Now pretend a request has been accepted. Your fake GPU can only do a limited amount of work per step.

Write:

```
step(waiting, running, budget)
```

Each call to `step()` means: "The GPU gets one more chance to do work."

You must support three ways of choosing requests:

- `fcfs`
- `priority`
- `drr`

So: priority 0 → before priority 20.

If priorities are equal, use arrival time.

### Rules

**Don't process huge prompts all at once.** If a request has a 32,000-token prompt but the step budget is 2,048, do not process all 32,000 tokens at once. Process at most 2,048 this step and continue later. This is chunked prefill.

**Don't let one huge prompt block decoding.** After processing at most one prefill chunk, use the remaining capacity for requests that are already decoding:

```
one prefill chunk
        ↓
use whatever remains for decoding
```

**If KV memory runs out, preempt.** Stop the lowest-priority running request. Throw away its KV memory and put it back into the waiting queue. When it runs again, it has to recompute its prompt. This is intentionally preempt, not swap.

Count:

- `preempts`
- `wasted_decode_tokens`

**If the client disconnects** (`req.aborted == True`), remove it immediately. Free its KV memory and do not generate any more tokens for it.

Count:

- `aborted_freed`

### Run this workload

`traces/mixed.jsonl` (from `python generate_traces.py`):

- 70% interactive — priority 0, prompt 200–800, output 64–256
- 20% batch — priority 20, prompt 2,000–8,000, output 512–2,048
- 10% shared-prefix agents — same prefix, prompt 4,000, 3,500 tokens shared

Run for 60 simulated seconds using FCFS, Priority, and DRR.

Measure:

- completed requests / second
- interactive p99 TTFT
- batch p99 TTFT
- preempts / second
- wasted decode tokens
- requests rejected

**Answer:** Which scheduler wastes the most decode work? Explain why in one paragraph.

---

## Part 3. Router — Which worker/GPU should get the request?

File: `router.py`

Now create two fake workers: Worker A and Worker B.

Each worker tells you:

- how much KV memory is free
- how many requests are running
- how many are waiting
- which prefixes it has cached
- its p99 latency
- whether it is healthy

Write:

```
pick(req, workers)
```

It chooses where the request goes.

Support:

- `random`
- `least_loaded`
- `p2c`
- `prefix_then_load`

### Three safety rules

**Missing information does NOT mean zero load.** If a worker is unhealthy or its load score is unknown: unknown ≠ idle.

Only use unknown workers if all workers are unknown. This is H6.

**Don't bounce an overloaded request forever.** Before choosing a worker, check whether each worker would reject the request using your Part 1 admission logic.

If both workers reject it:

```
return Shed(503, retry_after=2)
```

Do not go A → B → A → B. This is H4.

### Router experiments

Run three traces.

**T1 — No shared prefixes** (`traces/t1_unique.jsonl`)

Every request has a different prefix.

Question: Does P2C balance load better than random?

**T2 — Lots of shared prefixes** (`traces/t2_shared.jsonl`)

40% of requests share one prefix.

Question: Does prefix-aware routing save KV memory?

You should see approximately:

```
KV(prefix_then_load) < 0.4 × KV(least_loaded)
```

**T3 — Bad/stale information** (`traces/t3_stale.jsonl`)

Make worker B's information 15 seconds old. Its cached information says "B is empty" even though B is actually busy.

Show that `least_loaded` can send too much traffic to B.

Then show that your unknown/stale-telemetry handling prevents this mistake.

**Report** p99 TTFT, KV allocated, shed %, traffic sent to stale B — for all four routing strategies.

---

## Part 4. Put everything together

File: `serve.py`

Your complete system should behave like:

```
client
   ↓
Should we accept it?
   ↓
admit()
   ↓
Which worker?
   ↓
pick()
   ↓
worker queue
   ↓
GPU step
   ↓
step()
```

Use:

- one process
- two fake workers
- one simulated clock

---

## Submit

```
admit.py
sched.py
router.py
serve.py
tests/          # only if you are doing advanced
traces/
plots/soak.png
REPORT.pdf      # ≤ 2 pages (all tables with short explanations)
```

By the end of this, you should be able to answer:

- Where do I prevent accepting work that will time out?
- Where do I protect KV memory?
- Where do I prioritize interactive traffic?
- Where do I prevent one tenant from monopolizing the GPU?
- Where do I preempt a request?
- Where do I exploit shared prefixes?
- Where do I handle missing worker telemetry?
- Where do I stop failover from making overload worse?

## Advanced

These tests are real postmortems (OpenAI, Anthropic). Fix the problems the way their engineering teams do.

### 1. DALL·E soak

Set:

- timeout = 5 seconds
- p50 job time = 2 seconds

Keep sending requests until estimated queue wait exceeds 2.5 seconds. Your system must start shedding before completed requests fall to zero.

Create `plots/soak.png` showing admitted, completed, shed over time.

### 2. Worker failure and recovery

Kill worker B. Admission should decrease.

Bring B back. Gradually increase admission from 10% to 100% over 30 seconds.

Only continue increasing while `p99 TTFT < 2 × baseline`.

If latency exceeds that: stop increasing and shed traffic.

### 3. Correct error code

Tenant over token limit + empty fleet → `429`, not `503`.

Fleet out of KV + tenant under its limit → `503`/`529`, not `429`.

### 4. Prefix stickiness

On T2:

```
prefix_then_load KV < 0.4 × least_loaded KV
```

### 5. Abort

Abort a request during decoding.

The next `step()` must:

- free its KV
- increment `aborted_freed`
- generate zero additional tokens
